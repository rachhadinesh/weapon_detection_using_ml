Security is always a primary concern in every domain, due to a rise in crime rate in crowded events or suspicious lonely areas
Gun violence is a daily tragedy that affects the lives of people around the world. At least or more than 400 people die every single day because of violence committed with these weapons.
The growing demand for protecting safety, security, and personal properties, the need and deployment of video surveillance systems can recognize and interpret the scene, and anomaly events play a vital role in intelligence monitoring.
